tom-sync
========
Copy files between computers with different protocols.

Data model
----------
tom-sync is an abstract way of versioning a particular directory.
The directory contains a `.tomsync` file that specifies the transfer
protocol and the remote location.

The transfer protocol is one of the following.

* `rsync-public`
* `git-public`
* `fossil-public`
* `rsync-private`
* `fossil-private`

The remote location is a list of host-path pairs.
Here are some common remotes.

* `nsa:public/tom-sync/rsync`
* `nsa:public/tom-sync/git`
* `nsa:public/tom-sync/fossil`
* `nsa:private/tom-sync/rsync`
* `nsa:private/tom-sync/fossil`
* `github:tlevine/tom-sync`
* `gitlab:tlevine/tom-sync`

(Actually, maybe I just don't have this at all; I'm designing this
specifically for my own systems and the name is always the directory.)

On nsa the `public` directory gets served to the web, and the private
directory does not.

rsync-public
^^^^^^^^^^^^
rsync-public directories are transferred between local and remote with
`rsync --archive --exclude=.tomsync`.
I don't use `--delete` because it's too easy to lose
data by accident that way. I should really switch rsync for something
else that has some versioning.

On nsa resulting directory is served as static files from Apache.

git-public
^^^^^^^^^^
git-public directories are transferred with `git push` and `git pull`.
Use git commands if you want to do anything else.

On nsa resulting repository is checked out in a post-receive hook and
then is served as static files from Apache. The ".git" directories are
not served, though, because then bots download lots of small files and
use lots of resources.

fossil-public
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
fossil-public directories are transferred with `fossil sync`.
(Is that right?)

On nsa they are served from apache as
[CGI programs](https://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/server.wiki)

rsync-private
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
rsync-private directories are first encrypted at the file level.
Directory structures and file names are not encrypted; only the file
contents are encrypted. The encrypted files are stored on the server.

Here are two approaches to encrypting the files locally.

1. Put unencrypted files in an EncFS or PEFS, and synchronize the
   underlying encrypted files.
2. Encrypt individual files with GPG in a temporary directory, and
   synchronize the GPG-encrypted files.

A disadvantage of the first approach is that it is less portable and
might be more annoying to set up. In particular, I might wind up stuck
with a Linux kernel or a BSD kernel.

The only issue I see with the second approach is that it might take
longer to write. But it also might not.

fossil-private
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Instead of using fossil's built-in synchronization, encrypt the fossil
repository and copy that to the

User interface
--------------
These commands are available

    _ init rsync-public [name]
    _ init rsync-private [name]
    _ init git-public [name]
    _ init fossil-public [name]
    _ init fossil-private [name]
    _ commit
    _ push
    _ fetch

The following aliases should also be set.

    alias i=_\ i
    alias j=_\ j
    alias p=_\ p
    alias f=_\ f

The `commit`, `push`, and `fetch` commands are translated to appropriate
protocol-specific commands.

The `init` command does this.

1. Use the name argument as the name if such an argument is passed;
   otherwise, default to the basename of the working directory.
2. If the project is on nsa, tom-sync reports the protocol of the project.
3. If the protocol is git-public or fossil-public or if the project is
   not on nsa, tom-sync also reports whether a project with that name is
   on github and gitlab.
4. If the project is on nsa, tom-sync asks whether you want to fetch the
   project from nsa. If you say no, tom-sync exits.
5. If the project is not on nsa but is somewhere else, tom-sync asks
   whether you want to import the project from there. If you say no,
   tom-sync exits.
6. tom-sync pushes the project to all remotes.
