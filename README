tom-sync
========
Copy files between computers with different protocols.

These commands are available

    _ init rsync-public
    _ init rsync-private
    _ init git-public
    _ init fossil-public
    _ init fossil-private
    _ commit
    _ push

I can use the first letter of each subcommand (that is, "i", "c", or
"p") instead of the full word. Subsubcommands (like "rsync-private")
must be written out in full.
