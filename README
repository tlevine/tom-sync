tom-sync
========
Copy files between computers with different protocols.

Data model
----------
tom-sync is an abstract way of versioning a particular directory.
The directory contains a `.tomsync` file that specifies the transfer
protocol and the remote location.

The transfer protocol is one of the following.

* `rsync-public`
* `rsync-private`
* `git-public`
* `fossil-public`
* `fossil-private`

The remote location is a list of host-directory pairs.
Here are some common remotes.

* `nsa:public/tom-sync`
* `nsa:private/tom-sync`
* `github:tlevine/tom-sync`
* `gitlab:tlevine/tom-sync`

On nsa the `public` directory gets served to the web, and the private
directory does not.

rsync-public
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User interface
--------------
These commands are available

    _ init rsync-public
    _ init rsync-private
    _ init git-public
    _ init fossil-public
    _ init fossil-private
    _ commit
    _ push
    _ pull

I can use the first letter of each subcommand (that is, "i", "c", or "p")
instead of the full word. Subsubcommands (like "rsync-private") must be
written out in full.
