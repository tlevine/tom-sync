tom-sync
========
Copy files between computers with different protocols.

Data model
----------
tom-sync is an abstract way of versioning a particular directory.
The directory contains a `.tomsync` file with one of the following.

* rsync-public
* rsync-private
* git-public
* fossil-public
* fossil-private

Storage
^^^^^^^

User interface
--------------
These commands are available

    _ init rsync-public
    _ init rsync-private
    _ init git-public
    _ init fossil-public
    _ init fossil-private
    _ commit
    _ push
    _ pull

I can use the first letter of each subcommand (that is, "i", "c", or "p")
instead of the full word. Subsubcommands (like "rsync-private") must be
written out in full.
