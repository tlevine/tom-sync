tom-sync
========
Copy files between computers with different protocols.

Data model
----------
tom-sync is an abstract way of versioning a particular directory.
The directory contains a `.tomsync` file that specifies the transfer
protocol and the remote location.

The transfer protocol is one of the following.

* `rsync-public`
* `git-public`
* `fossil-public`
* `rsync-private`
* `fossil-private`

The remote location is a list of host-directory pairs.
Here are some common remotes.

* `nsa:public/tom-sync`
* `nsa:private/tom-sync`
* `github:tlevine/tom-sync`
* `gitlab:tlevine/tom-sync`

On nsa the `public` directory gets served to the web, and the private
directory does not.

rsync-public
^^^^^^^^^^^^
rsync-public directories are transferred between local and remote with
`rsync --archive --exclude=.tomsync`.
I don't use `--delete` because it's too easy to lose
data by accident that way. I should really switch rsync for something
else that has some versioning.

On nsa resulting directory is served as static files from Apache.

git-public
^^^^^^^^^^
git-public directories are transferred with `git push` and `git pull`.
Use git commands if you want to do anything else.

On nsa resulting repository is checked out in a post-receive hook and
then is served as static files from Apache. Routes containing a ".git"
directory are not served, though, because then bots download lots of
small files and use lots of resources.

fossil-public
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
fossil-public directories are transferred with `fossil sync`.
(Is that right?)

They are served from apache as
[CGI programs](https://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/server.wiki)

rsync-private
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User interface
--------------
These commands are available

    _ init rsync-public
    _ init rsync-private
    _ init git-public
    _ init fossil-public
    _ init fossil-private
    _ commit
    _ push
    _ fetch

The following aliases should also be set.

    alias i=_\ i
    alias j=_\ j
    alias p=_\ p
    alias f=_\ f
